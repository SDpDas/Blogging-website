# Project README

Special thanks to **Raddy** and **Net Ninja team** for the eventful journey I had with them doing this amazing project.

## FRONTEND
- **EJS:** Type of HTML embedded JS which works similar to HTML
- **CSS and JS**

## BACKEND
- **MongoDB:** Storing database of different blog posts
- **NodeJS:** For starting and connecting our app to localhost
- **Mongoose:** Shares info to MongoDB Compass
- **ExpressJS:** Useful in building our API

Lots of routing methods were used by JavaScript hence only clickable features in web interaction.
